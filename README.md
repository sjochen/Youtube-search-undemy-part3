# Youtube-search-undemy-part3

### What this app does
This app calls on the YouTube API to show videos related to the users search.

### Technologies Used
**HTML** **CSS** **JavaScript** **jQuery** **VSCode** **Fancybox**

### How to improve the app
Google recently updated its cookie sharing policy so it stops fancybox from oprening the modal on the same screen. I am currently looking into a way to get around this update but have not had much luck.

I would also like to put in a database so users can save their favorite videos and add notes which can be referenced at a later date.
